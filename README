No one, however I did accidentaly see a solution on creating a barrier class
in Python. I was looking for the Barrier class and found it for Python 3. I went
to look for something similiar in Python 2 and the answer was there and short,
so very hard to not see it and figure out the answer from it.

Instructions for running:
USGAE: ./rockband.py [music text file]

The music text files should look like the ones provided. The sound files
must be located in a directory called "media" that is in the same directory
as rockband.py. When running the above command, you should start to hear
music.

p.s. I tried making Piano Man. Tab credit below:
