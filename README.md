Musical project for Comp 50 CP: Concurrent Programming at Tufts University

Using Python threading, this program takes in a text file containing a 
list of instruments and their associated tabs, represented as a string
made up of numbers and 'rest' symbols (e.g. "xx3xx8xxx999xxx1").  After
parsing, the program then allows the user to write new notes to the tab
and to control the flow of the song: pausing, resuming, fast-forwarding, 
ect.  With all that, the program offers a UI so that the user can easily
interact with the program and begin to create their own music!
